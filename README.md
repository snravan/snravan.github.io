### Hello!


+Sophie Ravanbakht is a final-year doctoral candidate in the Gilling’s School of Global Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management, minoring in Decision Sciences and Outcomes Research. Sophie’s research interests center on exploring solutions to complex health problems that emerge from systemic and cultural intersections affecting underserved immigrant and pediatric populations.  Using systems science (e.g. systems dynamics) and a mixed-methods approach in her research, Sophie is interested in the biosocial influence of immigration and acculturation across generations and the life course in order to improve clinical guidelines, patient-centered care, policy guidance, and community resources for vulnerable populations. 

+Through her dissertation, Sophie seeks to increase understanding of how stress-related mechanisms that underlie discordant acculturation in Latino immigrant children and their caregivers influence health behaviors, quality of life, and weight status.



I am a current cancer prevention [postdoc fellow](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cancer-prevention-fellowship/people/natalie-smith/) at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. I'm mentored by Dr. Doug Levy and Dr. Karen Emmons. 

I also work with Dr. Davene Wright as a [Pyle Fellow](https://twitter.com/DeptPopMed/status/1556701937537585153) in the Department of Population Medicine/Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. 

I completed my PhD in 2021 in Health Policy and Management at UNC Chapel Hill in the Gillings School of Global Public Health, under the direction of Leah Frerichs. My main area of focus was Decision Sciences and Outcomes Research. From 2018-2021 I was a predoctoral trainee at the Carolina Population Center. The training program focuses on helping PhD students integrate approaches from the social and health sciences to address important public health problems. Before that, I earmed my MS in Biostatistics, also from UNC Chapel Hill.

Please get in touch!
